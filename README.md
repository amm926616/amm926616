### About Me
    🌏 Location: Myanmar
    🎓 Education: Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of the People (UoPeople).
    🖥️ Skills:
        Programming Languages: Proficient in Python; experienced in Java and JavaScript.
        Frameworks & Tools: PyQt6, Tkinter, web programming basics, and bash scripting for workflow automation.
        GUI Development: Built several software applications using Python.
        Miscellaneous: Experienced in writing scripts and solving technical problems efficiently.

### Vision

I believe that knowledge defines who we are. For me, the purpose of life is to explore and acquire knowledge that fuels my creativity and keeps boredom at bay. My ultimate wish is to have a stable and secure life, where I can support my loved ones while diving into the mysteries of the universe—pondering the principles and laws of physics.

If only I had a "time vault" to endlessly learn and explore, I'd gladly embrace it. My INTP mindset drives me to seek perfection in understanding, but when it comes to projects, I focus on achieving goals first and polishing perfection later—ensuring consistent progress and completion.
Strengths

    🤔 INTP personality: Analytical, detail-oriented, and focused on understanding systems.
    🛠️ Problem solver: Skilled at breaking down complex systems and identifying solutions.
    🌟 Passionate learner: Quick to learn and adapt to new tools, systems, and environments.
    💡 Creative thinker: Excels in exploring multiple perspectives to solve problems.

### Interests

    🧩 Hobbies: Chess, solving Rubik's cubes, tackling math and science problems and over-thinking(not in a bad way but I can't live withouth a single thought in my head).
    🚀 Passions: Programming, exploring new ideas, and continuous learning.

### Work Experience
    
    🏫 Teaching: I tutored English and taught computer basics to children. 
    I favor an approach that emphasizes intellect and creativity, encouraging abstract thinking and the exploration of ideas with or without real-world examples.
    My teaching style focuses on delivering the underlying concepts first, inspiring kids to develop a deeper interest in math, science, and the beauty of these subjects.
    Many of the students I tutored became more passionate about these fields. I take pride in being the kind of teacher who instills curiosity and a love for learning. 
    However, my approach requires active engagement. Lazy students who don't want to think won't thrive under my guidance.    
    💎 Jewelry Craftsmanship: My dad is a gold smith. So, I grew up seeing the jewelry craftmanships. Since I understand how jewelry crafting and how a crafting project is done, I can also create my own piece of jewelry. I have experiences in jewelry 3D designing. 
    🏦 Banking: Worked in the Credit Product Management Department at KBZ Bank.
    🚢 Shipping & Customer Service: Hands-on experience in logistics and customer relations.
    💻 Typing: Average speed of 60 WPM in both English and Burmese.

### Languages

    English: Advanced proficiency.
    Burmese: Native speaker.
    Korean: Basic level (self-taught).    

### Career Goals
  
I am passionate about software engineering and aspire to build a meaningful career in the IT industry. I thrive in problem-solving environments and am driven to constantly improve my skills and knowledge. I am particularly interested in building my own products with an entrepreneurial mindset, leaving a legacy where I can contribute my lifetime assets to aid the advancement of humanity.
